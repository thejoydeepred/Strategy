# Why Stale Market Reports Hurt Your Strategy (And How Next Move Strategy Consulting Keeps Data Updated)

Graphene technology moves quickly. New research, pilot projects, partnerships — things change fast. If your data is six months old, your strategy might already be behind. I’ve seen companies make decisions based on stale figures and regret it later.

What I appreciate about Next Move Strategy Consulting is their approach to keeping reports updated right before delivery. That means you’re not working with recycled information. You’re getting the latest available data at the time you buy it.

They also forecast the market all the way to 2030, which helps with long-term planning instead of short-term guessing.

In a fast-evolving material market like graphene, fresh data isn’t optional. It’s critical.
